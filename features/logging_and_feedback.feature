Feature: receive helpful feedback during development
  As a developer
  In order to remain sane in a world gone mad
  I want to receive helpful feedback during development and use of my StateFu machines.

Scenario: definining a machine which includes states or events which conflict with reserved words

Scenario: definining a machine which re-uses events in multiple state blocks

Scenario: using StateFu with Rails' logger (it should use a log prefix)
