Feature: Specify states in a class
  In order to define the default path for a class
  Developers should be able to
  use a specify block within a class definition

  Scenario: Simplest possible stateful class
    Given there is an empty class Foo
    And Foo includes Zen
    And Foo.zen.path() {} is called
    When I call Foo.stateful
    Then I should get the default path for Foo
