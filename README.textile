h1. Zen / Koan

h3. Why pile your classes full of business logic, when you can teach them to meditate until they find enlightenment?

[ EXPERIMENTAL / STUB / PROTOTYPE ]

This is a ground-up rewrite of Stateful. 

It should:

 * be a powerful DSL for building state machines, describing complex workflows and domain logic, and managing much of the state in a typical application.
 * play nicely with, but not require, ActiveRecord and / or Rails.

Interested parties should install cucumber and run `rake features`. 

Your feedback is valued.

Those seeking a production-ready alternative should see jbarnette-stateful or rubyist-aasm.
