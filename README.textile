h1. StateFu ( ALPHA / UNRELEASED )

State Fu is a rich framework for describing state machines,
workflows and rules engines in ruby and/or Rails.

It aims to be the most featureful, expressive and powerful such
library available, without sacrificing ease of use, clarity, or
performance.

State-Fu is currently under active development (no releases
yet). Those seeking a production-ready alternative should consider
rubyist-aasm or jbarnette-stateful.
