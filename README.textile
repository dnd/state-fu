h1. State-Fu

h2. What is it?

State-Fu is:

 * an unique toolkit for state-oriented programming

 * a rich DSL for describing workflows, rules engines and behaviour

 * something you've probably wanted for a long time but didn't know it

It lets you describe:

 * series of discrete states

 * events which can change the current state

 * rules about when these events can occur

 * behaviours which occur when they do

Other libraries exist for ruby which do some or all of these
things. "What's different about State-Fu?", you may ask.

Those libraries you've played with are toys. They're made of
plastic. State-Fu is forged from a reassuringly dense but
unidentifiable metal which comes only from the rarest of meteorites,
and it ticks when you hold it up to your ear.

State-Fu is elegant, powerful and transparent enough that you can use
it to drive substantial parts of your application, and actually want
to do so.

Some of the features which set State-Fu apart are:

 * a lovely, simple and flexible API

 * use an ActiveRecord field for state persistence, or just an
   attribute - or use both, on the same class, for different workflows

 * define any number of workflows on the same object / model, or re-use
   them across multiple classes

 * events can transition from / to any number of states

 * drive application behaviour with a rich set of event hooks

 * define behaviour as methods on your objects, or keep it all in the
   state machine itself

 * guard conditions determine at runtime whether a particular state
   transition can occur, and if not, tell a user what they must do
   to satisfy the requirements

 * transitions can be halted midway, and you can actually determine
   why, and where from

 * use helpers to extend State-Fu to suit your problem domain

 * store arbitrary meta-data on any component of a machine - a simple
   but extremely useful tool for integration

 * design for transparency, introspection and ease of debugging means
   a dynamic, powerful system you can actually use

 * fast, lightweight and useful enough to use in any ruby
   project - works with Rails but does not require it.

State-Fu works with ruby 1.8 and 1.9.
