h1. StateFu

State Fu is a rich framework for describing state machines,
workflows and rules engines in ruby and/or Rails.

It aims to be the most featureful, expressive and powerful such
library available, without sacrificing ease of use, clarity, or
performance.

h2. Status

State-Fu is currently under active development. I'm not yet using it
in production, but it has a fairly stable API, reasonable spec
coverage and should have features sufficient for most use cases.

It plays nicely with both ActiveRecord models and standard ruby
classes; it requires ActiveSupport but not ActiveRecord, and will use
an ActiveRecord column for persistence if an appropriate column
exists. You can even mix machines using ActiveRecord- &
attribute-based persistence on the same model.

Until I've written an introductory example specifically for this
README, you can take a look at the specs (especially the integration
specs) for example usage.

Note that the 'rspec' and 'rr' gems are required to run the specs.
