* Bugs
** Koans are not inherited. Is this a bug?
   To make them inheritable we'd be back to needing a Binding
   or some other substantial complexity.
   I don't think it's worth it.

* Features / Todo

** Documentation
*** high-level overviews
**** of the API / syntax
**** of the behind-the-scenes action and how classes relate

** Koans should be
*** duplicable
**** store blocks passed to them in an array so that they can be replayed?
**** use a recorder pattern?
*** castable to string / json / ... without looking like ass
*** able to generate dot / graphviz
*** $@ from Stateful

** Class/object API
*** should be interchangeable

** Contexts
*** should be extensible by the user to create a custom DSL
**** how to work this into the DSL? Scope?

** Definition syntax
*** use e.g. state(:foo) { |s| ... } or state(:foo) { ... } ?
**** consider the merits carefully
     discussion here
**** support both?
***** 'pretty version' as default
***** 'nasty version' for advanced stuff / use as a full DSL

* Specs pending

* Code smells

* Other
** testing w/ heckle, rcov
** decide where to use Cucumber & where Rspec
** benchmark / tune for performance
*** Cuc. for user-facing API; Rspec for internals?
