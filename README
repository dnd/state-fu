Why pile your classes full of business logic, when you can teach them to meditate until they find enlightenment?

[ EXPERIMENTAL / STUB / PROTOTYPE ]

This is a ground-up rewrite of Stateful. 

It is will be a powerful DSL for building state machines, describing complex workflows and domain logic, and managing state in more of your Ruby classes than you might think.

It plays nicely with, but does not require ActiveRecord and / or Rails.

Interested parties should install cucumber and run `rake features`. 

Under very active development - feedback valued.
